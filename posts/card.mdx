```python
import random

# 扑克牌类
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, value):
        self.suit = suit
        self.value = value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.value} of {self.suit}"

# 牌组类
class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        suits = ['Spades', 'Hearts', 'Clubs', 'Diamonds']
        values = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
        for suit in suits:
            for value in values:
                self.cards.append(Card(suit, value))

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal(self, num_hands, num_cards_per_hand):
        hands = []
        for _ in range(num_hands):
            hand = [self.cards.pop() for _ in range(num_cards_per_hand)]
            hands.append(hand)
        return hands

# 创建牌组并洗牌
deck = Deck()
deck.shuffle()

# 发牌给4个玩家，每人5张
hands = deck.deal(4, 5)

# 打印每个玩家的手牌
for i, hand in enumerate(hands):
    print(f"Player {i+1} hand: {', '.join(repr(card) for card in hand)}")
```

## Experience

This segment of code first defines the Card class and the Deck class. The Card class is used to create poker card objects, while the Deck class is used to create a deck of cards and provides methods for shuffling and dealing cards.

The __repr__ method of the Card class defines how to print Card objects, making them easy to read.

The shuffle method of the Deck class uses Python's random.shuffle function to randomly shuffle the cards in the deck.

The deal method distributes cards from the deck to a specified number of players, with each player receiving a specified number of cards. Cards are taken from the end of the deck using the pop method, ensuring that cards are not reused.

Please note that this example code is a simple demonstration, and actual poker games may require more complex logic, such as handling jokers, cards of various suits, scoring, and game rules, etc.
