```python
import random

# 扑克牌类
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, value):
        self.suit = suit
        self.value = value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.value} of {self.suit}"

# 牌组类
class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        suits = ['Spades', 'Hearts', 'Clubs', 'Diamonds']
        values = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
        for suit in suits:
            for value in values:
                self.cards.append(Card(suit, value))

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal(self, num_hands, num_cards_per_hand):
        hands = []
        for _ in range(num_hands):
            hand = [self.cards.pop() for _ in range(num_cards_per_hand)]
            hands.append(hand)
        return hands

# 创建牌组并洗牌
deck = Deck()
deck.shuffle()

# 发牌给4个玩家，每人5张
hands = deck.deal(4, 5)

# 打印每个玩家的手牌
for i, hand in enumerate(hands):
    print(f"Player {i+1} hand: {', '.join(repr(card) for card in hand)}")
```

## Heading H2

That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Across from where? That's why you always leave a note! I hear the jury's still out on science.

I hear the jury's still out on science. I hear the jury's still out on science. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.
